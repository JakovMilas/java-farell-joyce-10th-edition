Task:
Write a program for Horizon Phones, a provider of cellular phone service.
Prompt a user for maximum monthly values for talk minutes needed, text
messages needed, and gigabytes of data needed, and then display a
recommendation for the best plan for the customerâ€™s needs. A customer who
needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and no text or data should buy Plan A
at $49 per month. A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and
any text messages should buy Plan B at $55 per month. A customer who needs
500 or more minutes of talk and no data should buy either Plan C for up to
100 text messages at $61 per month or Plan D for 100 text messages or more
at $70 per month. A customer who needs any data should buy Plan E for up to
3 gigabytes at $79 per monthor Plan F for 3 gigabytes or more at $87 per month.
Save the file as CellPhoneService.java.
