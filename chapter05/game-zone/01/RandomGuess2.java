Task:
Create a class called RandomGuess2 that contains a game in which a player
guesses a random number. (See Appendix D for help with creating a random number.) Allow a player to enter a guess, and then display a message indicating whether
the playerâ€™s guess was correct, too high, or too low.
Save the file as RandomGuess2.java.
