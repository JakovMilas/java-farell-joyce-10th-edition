Chapter 01, exercise 11

Task:
From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to highways across the United States.
There were always four or five signs in a row containing pieces of a rhyme, followed by a final sign that read
Burma Shave. For example, one set of signs that has been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution reads as
follows:
Shaving brushes
You’ll soon see ’em
On a shelf
In some museum
Burma Shave
Find a classic Burma Shave rhyme on the Web, making sure the fifth line is Burma Shave. Write, compile, and
test a class that displays the slogan. Save the class as BurmaShave.java.
