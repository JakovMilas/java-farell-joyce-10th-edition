Chapter 06, exercise 13

Task:
Next, create an application that declares a Purchase object and prompts
the user for purchase details. When you prompt for an invoice number,
do not let the user proceed until a number between 1,000 and 8,000 inclusive
has been entered. When you prompt for a sale amount, do not proceed until the
user has entered a nonnegative value. After a valid Purchase object has been
created, display the objectâ€™s invoice number, sale amount, and sales tax.
Save the file as CreatePurchase.java.
