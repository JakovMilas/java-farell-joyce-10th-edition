Chapter 03, exercise 10

Task:
Create a class named FormLetterWriter that includes two overloaded methods named
displaySalutation(). The first method takes one String parameter that represents
a customerâ€™s first name, and it displays the salutation Dear followed by the first
name. The second method accepts two String parameters that represent a first and
last name, and it displays the greeting Dear followed by the first name, a space,
and the last name. After each salutation, display the rest of a short business
letter: Thank you for your recent order. Write a main() method that prompts the
user for a first and last name and tests each overloaded method.
Save the file as FormLetterWriter.java.
