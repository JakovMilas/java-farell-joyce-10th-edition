There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

Create a file that contains a line of your favorite song lyric. Use a text editor such as Notepad, and save
the file. Copy the file contents, and paste them into a word-processing program such as Word. Write an
application that prompts the user for the names of the files and displays the sizes of the two files as well as
the ratio of their sizes to each other. Save the file as FileSizeComparison.java.
