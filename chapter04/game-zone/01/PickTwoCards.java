Chapter 04, Game Zone 1

Task:
Write an application that randomly selects two playing cards and displays
their values. Simply assign a suit to each of the cards, but generate a random
number for each cardâ€™s value. The following statements generate a random number
between 1 and 13 and assign it to a variable:
final int CARDS_IN_SUIT = 13;
myValue = ((int)(Math.random() * 100) % CARDS_IN_SUIT + 1);
Later in this course, you will be able to have the game determine the higher card.
For now, just observe how the card values change as you execute the program
multiple times. Save the application as PickTwoCards.java.
