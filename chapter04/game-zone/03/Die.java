Chapter 04, Game Zone 3

Task:
Dice are used in many games. One die can be thrown to randomly show a value
from 1 through 6. Design a Die class that can hold an integer data field for
a value (from 1 to 6). Include a constructor that randomly assigns a value to
a die object. For example, the following statement generates a random number
between LOWEST_DIE_VALUE (which should contain the value 1) and HIGHEST_DIE_VALUE
(which should contain the value 6) and assigns it to a variable.
randomValue = ((int)(Math.random() * 100) % HIGHEST_DIE_VALUE + LOWEST_DIE_VALUE);
Also include a method in the class to return a Dieâ€™s value. Save the class as Die.java.
