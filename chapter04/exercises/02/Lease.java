Chapter 04, exercise 02a

Task:
Create a class named Lease with fields that hold an apartment tenantâ€™s name,
apartment number, monthly rent amount, and term of the lease in months.
Include a default constructor that initializes the name to XXX, the apartment
number to 0, the rent to 1000, and the term to 12. Also include methods to get
and set each of the fields. Include a nonstatic method named addPetFee() that
adds $10 to the monthly rent value and calls a static method named
explainPetPolicy() that explains the pet fee. Save the class as Lease.java.
