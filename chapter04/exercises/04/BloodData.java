Task:
Create a class named BloodData that includes String fields that hold a
blood type (the four blood types are O, A, B, and AB) and an Rh factor
(the factors are + and â€“). Create a default constructor that sets the
fields to O and + and an overloaded constructor that requires values
for both fields. Include get and set methods for each field.
