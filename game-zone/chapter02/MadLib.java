Chapter 02, Game Zone 1

Task:
Mad Libs is a childrenâ€™s game in which they provide a few words that are then incorporated into a silly story.
The game helps children understand different parts of speech because they are asked to provide specific types
of words. For example, you might ask a child for a noun, another noun, an adjective, and a past-tense verb.
The childmight reply with such answers as table, book, silly, and studied. The newly created Mad Lib might
be the following:
Mary had a little table
Its book was silly as snow
And everywhere that Mary studied
The table was sure to go.
Create a Mad Libs program that asks the user to provide at least four or five words, and then create
and display a short story or nursery rhyme that uses them. Save the file as MadLib.java.
