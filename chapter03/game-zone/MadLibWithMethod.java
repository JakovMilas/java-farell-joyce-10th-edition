Chapter 03, Game Zone 1

Task:
Mad Libs is a childrenâ€™s game in which the players provide a few words that are then
incorporated into a silly story. For example, you might ask a child for the name of
an animal, a number, and a direction. The child might reply with such answers as dog,
13, and east. The newly created Mad Lib might be:
Hickory Dickory Dock.
The dog ran up the clock.
The clock struck 13.
The dog ran east.
Hickory Dickory Dock.
Create a program that asks the user to provide a few words. Then send the words to a
method that displays a short story or nursery rhyme that uses them.
Save the file as MadLibWithMethod.java.
