Task:
Recall how to obtain a random number. For example, the following statement generates a random number
between the constants MIN and MAX inclusive and assigns it to a variable named random:
random = MIN + (int)(Math.random() * MAX);
Write a program that selects a random number between 1 and 5 and asks the user to guess the number. Display
a message that indicates the difference between the random number and the userâ€™s guess. Display another
message that displays the random number and the Boolean value true or false depending on whether the
userâ€™s guess equals the random number. Save the file as RandomGuessMatch.java.
