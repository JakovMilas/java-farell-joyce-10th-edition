Chapter 02, exercise 07

Task:
Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges $3.25 for a dozen eggs or 45
cents for individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. Write a program that prompts a user for the number of
eggs in the order and then display the amount owed with a full explanation. For example, typical output might
be You ordered 27 eggs. Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each
for a total of $7.85. Save the program as Eggs.java.
