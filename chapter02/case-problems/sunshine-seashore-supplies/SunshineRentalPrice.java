Farrel Joyce - Java Programming, 10th Edition (2023)

Chapter 02, Case Problems 2

Task:
Sunshine Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes, beach chairs, and umbrellas to
tourists. Write a program that prompts the user for the number of minutes the user rented a piece of sports
equipment. Compute the rental cost as $40 per hour plus $1 per additional minute. (You might have surmised
already that this rate has a logical flaw, but for now, calculate rates as described here. You can fix the problem
after you learn about decision making.) Display Sunshineâ€™s motto with the border that you created in the
SunshineMotto2 class in Chapter 1. Then display the hours, minutes, and total price. Save the file as
SunshineRentalPrice.java.
